Shared Dependencies:

1. **Libraries**: Libraries such as Electron.js, PyQt, Spacy, NLTK, os, shutil, Google Calendar API, Outlook Calendar API, and PIL are shared across multiple files for various functionalities like UI/UX design, NLP, file and folder management, setting reminders, sending calendar invites, and image editing.

2. **User Input**: User input is a shared variable across the interface, intent recognition, and task execution modules. It is initially captured in the interface, interpreted in the intent recognition module, and finally used in the task execution module to perform the requested tasks.

3. **Intent and Entities**: Recognized intents and entities are shared between the intent recognition module and the task execution module. The intent recognition module identifies these from the user input, and the task execution module uses them to execute the appropriate tasks.

4. **Task Status**: The status of task execution (success/failure) might be shared between the task execution module and the interface to provide feedback to the user.

5. **User Consent**: User consent is a shared variable between the security module and all other modules that access user data or personal files.

6. **Encryption Keys**: Encryption keys used for data encryption and decryption are shared between the security module and any other module that sends or receives data.

7. **DOM Elements**: DOM elements like buttons, input fields, and display areas are shared between the interface files (ui.py, ux.py, main.py) and potentially the main.py file if it handles some part of the interface logic.

8. **Function Names**: Functions like `interpret_input()`, `execute_task()`, `encrypt_data()`, `decrypt_data()`, `get_user_consent()`, etc., are shared across multiple files as they are part of the core logic of the application.

9. **Message Names**: Message names for user feedback, error messages, and system notifications are shared across the interface and task execution modules.

10. **Data Schemas**: Data schemas defining the structure of user data, task data, and system data are shared across all modules for consistent data handling and storage.
